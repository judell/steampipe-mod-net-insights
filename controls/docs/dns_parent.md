## Overview

A parent domain is the top-level domain, e.g., `example.com`. When referring to an Internet address or name, a domain or domain name is the location of a website. For example, the domain name `google.com` points to the IP address `216.58.216.164`. Generally, it's easier to remember a name rather than a long string of numbers.
